          <p>
            In summer 2018, we organized
            <a href="https://hackchicago.io" target="_blank">Hack Chicago</a>,
            the Midwest's largest high school hackathon to-date.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're lucky. Since then, we've had the opportunity to experience
            dozens of fascinating student-run events like
            <a href="http://hackcincinnati.io/" target="_blank"
              >Hack Cincinnati</a
            >, <a href="https://hackpenn.com/" target="_blank">HackPenn</a> and
            <a href="https://windyhacks.com" target="_blank">Windy City Hacks</a
            >. But not everyone is that lucky, and not every high school
            hackathon can afford to provide travel aid.
