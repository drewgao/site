With the help of Execute Big's Travel Grant, high school junior Alayna Nguyen from Naperville, IL was able to attend PixelHacks IV, a 24-hour all-female student-run hackathon in the Bay Area. Alayna and her team created [Vitality](https://devpost.com/software/vitality), a web app that recommends recipes based on different users' dietary restrictions. They won the Best UiPath Automation Hacks award at PixelHacks!

This video is recorded and edited completely by Alayna.
